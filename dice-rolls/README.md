You have just rolled a dice several times. The N roll results that you remember are described by an array A. However, there are F rolls whose results you have forgotten. The arithmetic mean of all of the roll results (the sum of all the roll results divided by the number of rolls) equals M.

What are the possible results of the missing rolls?

## Write a function:

def solution(A, F, M)

that, given an array A of length N, an integer F and an integer M, returns an array containing possible results of the missed rolls. The returned array should contain F integers from 1 to 6 (valid dice rolls). If such an array does not exist, the function should return [0].

Examples:

1. Given A = [3, 2, 4, 3], F = 2, M = 4, your function should return [6, 6]. The arithmetic mean of all the rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.

2. Given A = [1, 5, 6], F = 4, M = 3, your function may return [2, 1, 2, 4] or [6, 1, 1, 1] (among others).

3. Given A = [1, 2, 3, 4], F = 4, M = 6, your function should return [0]. It is not possible to obtain such a mean.

4. Given A = [6, 1], F = 1, M = 1, your function should return [0]. It is not possible to obtain such a mean.

5. Corner Test Case. Given A=[6], F =10, and M = 4, your function should return [0]

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N and F are integers within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..6];
M is an integer within the range [1..6].
